# Medium-Facenet-Tutorial

Finished tutorial demonstrating use of Tensorflow, Dlib, and Scikit-learn to create a facial recognition pipeline.
Tutorial is here: https://hackernoon.com/building-a-facial-recognition-pipeline-with-deep-learning-in-tensorflow-66e7645015b8

> Enhancements:
Save and load session after pickling classifier
Capture an image and feed it into pickled classifer
